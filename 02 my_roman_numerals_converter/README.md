</h1>Welcome to My Roman Numerals Converter</h1>

<p>The code converts normal numbers to Roman Numerals.
The program returns the "result" - string which is the Roman numeral version of the input number.</p>


<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals.
Which returns the "result" - string which is the Roman numeral version of the input number.</p>


<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This code defines a function called "my_roman_numerals_converter" 
that takes in a number as its argument. It creates a dictionary called "roman_numerals" 
that maps integer values to their corresponding Roman numeral equivalents. 
The function then creates an empty string called "result" 
and uses a loop to iterate through the "roman_numerals" dictionary. 
The loop checks if the input number is greater than or equal to the key (integer value) in the dictionary, 
and if so, it adds the corresponding value (Roman numeral) to the "result" string 
and subtracts the key from the input number. This continues until the input number is less than the key, 
at which point the loop moves on to the next key. 
Finally, the function returns the "result" string which is the Roman numeral version of the input number.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>To run this Ruby code, you will need to have a Ruby interpreter installed on your computer. 
You can download the latest version of Ruby from the official website (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).</p>


<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Once you have Ruby installed, you can open a command prompt or terminal window, navigate to the directory where the file containing the code is located, and run the following command:</p>

<p>ruby file_name.rb</p>
<p>Replace "file_name.rb" with the actual name of the file containing the code - my_roman_numerals_converter.rb</p>

<p>You can also run the code in an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text, that has a ruby extension.</p>

<p>You can also test the function by calling it as follows:</p>

<p>my_roman_numerals_converter(1999)</p>
<p>This will return "MCMXCIX" which is the roman numeral for 1999.</p>
