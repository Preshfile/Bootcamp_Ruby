<h1>Welcome to Ruby Quest04</h1>

<h2>Task</h2>
<ul>
<li>Returning the index in a haystack</li>
<li>To Convert lowercase characters to uppercase</li>
<li>To convert uppercase characters to lowercase </li>
<li>To find the length of a string</li>
</ul>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>To Solve the problem, research on the concepts were carried out
and almost all the tasks were solved using predefined functions (string methods)
in the laguage such as upcase, downcase, stringlength and so on.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>To install Ruby on your machine, you will first need to download the installer
for your operating system from the official Ruby website (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/). Once the installer is downloaded, run it and follow the instructions to complete the installation.</p>

<p>After Ruby is installed, you can use the command line to navigate to the directory where the my_upcase, my_downcase and string_index files are located. </p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Then you can use the following command to run the file:</p>


<p>ruby [filename.rb]
<p>For example, if the files are my_upcase.rb, my_downcase.rb and my_string_index.rb  you can use the command:</p>

<p>ruby my_upcase.rb</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>ruby my_downcase.rb</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>ruby my_string_index.rb</p>

<p>To run each of the files.</p>
