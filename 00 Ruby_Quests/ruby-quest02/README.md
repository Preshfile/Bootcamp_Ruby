<h1>Welcome to Ruby Quest02</h1>

<p>Highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple coditional statements</li>
<li>Function</li>
<li>While loop</li>
<li>Parameters</li>
<li>Function return</li>
</ul>

<h2>Task</h2>
<p>There are four tasks to be carried on. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>To complete a multiple conditional statements</li>
<li>To write a function</li>
<li>To write a while loop</li>
<li>To declare a parameters</li>
<li>To return a value in a function</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Solutions were provided by understanding the following concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>multiple conditional statements in ruby</li>
<li>functions in ruby</li>
<li>while loop in ruby</li>
<li>How to declare a parameter in ruby</li>
<li>How to return a value in ruby function</li>
 </ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<ol>
<li>First, check if Ruby is already installed by typing ruby -v in the terminal. If you see a message with the version of Ruby that is installed, then you already have Ruby installed and you can skip to step 4.</li>

<li>If Ruby is not installed, you can install it by downloading the latest version from the official Ruby website (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).</li>

<li>Once the download is complete, open the installer and follow the prompts to install Ruby.</li>

<li>To verify that Ruby was installed correctly, type ruby -v in the terminal again. You should see a message with the version of Ruby that was installed.</li>

<li>You can also use a package manager like rbenv or rvm to manage multiple versions of Ruby on your system. These tools allow you to easily switch between different versions of Ruby and make it easier to install and manage gems (Ruby libraries).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To run a Ruby file, you will need to have a Ruby interpreter installed on your computer. If you don't have one, you can download the latest version of Ruby from the official website (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).</p>

<p>Once you have Ruby installed, you can run a Ruby file by opening a terminal or command prompt, navigating to the directory where the file is located, and then entering the command ruby file_name.rb, where file_name.rb is the name of your Ruby file.</p>

<p>For example, if your Ruby file is called hello.rb and it is in the current directory, you can run it by entering the following command:</p>


<p>ruby my_first_function.rb</p>
<p>This will execute the Ruby code in the file and display the output.</p>

<p>If you want to run a Ruby file with a different Ruby interpreter (e.g., if you have multiple versions of Ruby installed), you can specify the path to the interpreter in the command. </p>
<p>For example:</p>


<p>/path/to/interpreter/path/to/file.</p>
