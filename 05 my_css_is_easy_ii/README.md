<h1>Welcome to My Css Is Easy II</h1>
<p>My Css Is Easy II is a program  with an HTML document that uses Bootstrap CSS to create a webpage layout with a header, main section, sidebar, and footer. The layout uses a grid system with rows and columns, 
and each section is assigned a different background color for visual distinction. 
The document also includes a link to an external CSS file called "style.css" </p>

<h2>Task</h2>

It requires the use  of bootstrap 4, bootstrap 5 or TailWindCSS. The use of float is unacceptable.
